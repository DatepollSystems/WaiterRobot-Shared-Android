# Android & shared

This repository includes the Android App ([androidApp](./androidApp)) and the shared KMM
module ([shared](./shared)) for the WaiterRobot App. The iOS App can be
found [here](https://github.com/DatepollSystems/waiterrobot-mobile_iOS).

The Android App depends on the shared module directly through a gradle project dependency.

The shared module is also published as an SPM Package directly in this repo with a Package.swift in
the repo root. Therefore [KMMBridge](https://github.com/touchlab/KMMBridge) is used. The SPM Package
can be published by running the `KMM Bridge Publish Release` GitHub-Action.

## iOS dev with local KMM module version

For a guide to use a local version of the KMM module
see [KMMBridge local dev spm](https://touchlab.github.io/KMMBridge/spm/IOS_LOCAL_DEV_SPM)

The main branch contains the `Package.swift` file ready for local dev.

### Short version

1. `./gradlew spmDevBuild` (must be run after each change in the KMM module)
2. Drag the whole KMM project folder (top level git folder) into the WaiterRobot project in Xcode
3. Start programming :)
4. When finished delete folder, make sure to select "Remove References"!!! (otherwise the whole KMM
   project will be deleted locally)

## Releasing

### Android

Production release is triggered on push to main. The CI then builds the app and deploys it to
the `internal` Track on Google Play. After testing the app then must be promoted to production
manually from there. A tag in the form of `android-major.minor.patch` (e.g. android-1.0.0) is
created. (see [publishAndroid.yml](.github/workflows/publishAndroid.yml))
Do not forget to bump the android version ([version.properties](androidApp/version.properties)) on
the dev branch after a production release was made.

On each push to develop also a lava (dev) build is triggered and published to `internal` track of
the WaiterRobot Lava app on Google Play. A tag in the form
of `android-major.minor.patch-lava-epochMinutes` is created (e.g. android-1.0.1-lava-27935730). (
see [publishAndroid.yml](.github/workflows/publishAndroid.yml))

### Shared

Production release is triggered on push to main (only when shared module changed). The CI then
builds the Swift Package and releases to GitHub releases. A tag in the form of `major.minor.patch` (
e.g. 1.0.0) is created. (see [publishShared.yml](.github/workflows/publishShared.yml)
and [build.gradle.kts (shared)](shared/build.gradle.kts) kmmbridge config)

On each push to develop also a dev build is triggered and published to GitHub Packages. A tag in the
form of `major.minor.patch-lava-epochSeconds` (e.g. 1.0.1-dev-1676143102) and a corresponding GitHub
Release is created. (see [publishShared.yml](.github/workflows/publishAndroid.yml)
and [build.gradle.kts (shared)](shared/build.gradle.kts) kmmbridge config)
